## 📘 Description:
This project applies computational drug design methodologies to identify and evaluate novel anti-inflammatory peptides from deep-sea organisms for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). It integrates peptide mining, molecular modeling, docking, MD simulations, and ADMET profiling in a step-by-step pipeline.

## 🔬 Methodological Steps:
1. **Peptide Mining** from marine databases and literature.
2. **3D Modeling** and structure optimization.
3. **Molecular Docking** with RSV F and NS1 proteins.
4. **Molecular Dynamics** simulation for complex stability.
5. **Anti-inflammatory Target Docking** (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6).
6. **ADMET and Toxicity Prediction** using SwissADME and pkCSM.

## 🎯 Goals:
- Discover a stable and bioactive peptide with dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory action.
- Simulate interactions to validate binding and pharmacological profiles.

## 📊 Tools Used:
- PyMOL / MODELLER (3D structure)
- AutoDock Vina / DockingServer
- GROMACS / AMBER (MD Simulation)
- SwissADME / pkCSM (Toxicity and Pharmacokinetics)
